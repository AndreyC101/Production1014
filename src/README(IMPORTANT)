>Player movement has been revamped, and x/y collision is done separately to ensure nothing breaks when working with triggers
>Hide state has been fully completed, and entrance triggers are now fully functional
>All states now function properly, but menus need some adjustments
>Movement and collision checking is now done inside the PlayState, with appropriate functions added, player Update will be reserved for timers and animations only

TODO: 
>Map colliders need to be setup according to new map layout - this is done in the Playstate::GenerateLevel() function,
please pay close attention to the entry flags when populating the door vector, as this decided where the alcove will be entered from and how it will be displayed.
Doors also contain a type, with Alcove pushing the Hide state, and Exit switching the FSM to Win state. this will need to be changed when new levels are added.
>enemies need to be added to the PlayState, please note the order of translations and collision detection, this order prevents some nasty crashes and should be followed when adding enemies
>sound effects, animations to be added
